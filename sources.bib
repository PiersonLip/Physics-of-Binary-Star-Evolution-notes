	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of helium-core remnants of the primary components of intermediate-mass close binaries that lost most of their hydrogen-helium envelopes due to the mass exchange. These remnants are expected to be observed as hot helium-rich stars with masses of (1−7) {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, located in the area of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between OB subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars. While several thousands of such stripped helium stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy, none of them have been identified so far.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We aim to provide comprehensive predictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of stripped helium stars and their binary companions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations, to enable a comparison between binary evolution models and realistic stellar populations, and to determine the feedback parameters of stripped helium stars in the Galaxy.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We expanded the previously considered space of parameters describing close binary systems producing stripped helium stars and applied a population synthesis based on a grid of evolutionary models computed by the code MESA, using a spin-dependent algorithm for the treatment of mass and angular momentum loss from the system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We show that the number of Galactic binaries hosting (1−7) {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} He-stars is ≃20 000 and that it steeply declines with an increase in the He-star mass (≃3000 with mass ≳2 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}). The decisive factor that defines the low number of stripped He-stars is runaway mass-loss after Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) by primary components of the binaries, which leads to the formation of common envelopes and the further merger of components. This effect strongly restricts the initial ranges of masses of components of the progenitors of stripped stars and orbital periods. In addition, stripped helium stars are much less numerous than expected, since a significant fraction of binaries in which the primaries have masses less than (5−7) {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} produce subdwarfs with masses ≲1 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. Our calculations show that the overwhelming majority of helium stars reside in binaries with an early-type companion star and can be identified neither by the UV excess nor by emission features. The large periods of a significant fraction of binaries hosting stripped stars (≳several hundred days) also hamper their discovery.},

	abstract = {Stellar-mass black holes descend from high-mass stars, most of which had stellar binary companions. However, the number of those binary systems that survive the binary evolution and black hole formation is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive stars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most black hole X-ray binaries. We present a search for close black hole companions (orbital period ≲3 days, equivalent to separation ≲20 R⊙) to AFGK-type stars in TESS; that is, the non-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries. Such black holes can be detected by the tidally induced ellipsoidal deformation of the visible star, and the ensuing photometric light curve variations. From an initial sample of 4.7 × 106TESS stars, we have selected 457 candidate ellipsoidal variables with large mass ratios. However, after spectroscopic follow-up of 250 of them, none so far are consistent with a close black hole companion. On the basis of this non-detection, we determine (with 2σ confidence) that fewer than one in 105 solar-type stars in the solar neighbourhood hosts a short-period black hole companion. This upper limit is in tension with a number of 'optimistic' population models in the literature that predict short-period black hole companions around one in ∼104 ‑ 5 stars. Our limit is still consistent with other models that predict only a few in ∼107 ‑ 8.},
