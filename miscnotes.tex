\subsection{WD SNe}\label{WD-SNe}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item This, simply-ish put, is caused by because a WD cannot reach hydrostatic equilibrium. A pressure increase does \textbf{not} lead to increase and radius, and thus cooling, instead, it just increases heat, and thus fusion, quickly getting out of hand. Can b trigged if the \gls{chandrasekhar-limit} is crossed, as well as if a layer of H/He on top entities, called a \gls{edge-limit-detonation} or ``sub-Chandrasekhar'' explosions.
\item In \gls{DD} systems the WDs must have a small separation, causing \gls{GWR} to shrink the separation until merger \(\rightarrow\) SNe
