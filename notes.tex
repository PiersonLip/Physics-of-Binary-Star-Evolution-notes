\section{Intro}
\noindent \textbf{\large Importance of binaries}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Plays a key role in the evolution of massive stars
\item first presumed to exist because of \gls{algol-type} stars. These stars were explained with mass transfer
\item Mergers are a key source of strongest GW rad, GrBs, and have r-process elements. (i.e. in \gls{kilonova}) 
\item Likely cause of SNe Ia, Ib, Ic (SN with a lack of hydrogen in their spectra) 
\item cause of low-intermediate mass stars with odd chemical compositions, ex. barium stars. 
\end{list}

\section{Visual binaries and the universal validity of the laws of physics}

\subsection{Visual binaries}
\begin{list}{-}{}

\item Visual binary \(\rightarrow\) two in proximity through a telescope

\item Physical \(\rightarrow\) gravitonalty bound orbits

\item Optical \(\rightarrow\) happen to be close together in the sky

\end{list}

\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Visual binaries have longer orbits
\item the proof of physical binaries (and not just coincidence) was proved in 1767 by John Michell
\item Shows that Newton's law of gravity applied outside just our solar system
\end{list}
\subsection{Astrometric Binaries}
\noindent \textbf{\large Wide binaries} 
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Binaries where one of the stars is too faint to directly observe
\item Can still be detected by the following \gls{proper-motion} of the visible component
\item Center of mass moves along, star orbits this center, showing a periodic wiggle in its apparent motion (I wonder how this can be muddled with and/or separated from parallax. I'm guessing they are in different planes?? (next graphic helped(it wiggles slightly due to yearly parallax, however, the proper motion is much greater and over a much longer duration, so it sort of just becomes ``noise'' relative)))
\end{list}
\subsection{Spectroscopic Binaries}
\noindent \textbf{\large Spectroscopic Binaries}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item A binary which is determined to be a binary due to its spectra
\item double-lined binary (SB2) \(\rightarrow\) when both sets of spectral lines can be observed redshifting and blueshifting
\item single-lined (SB1) \(\rightarrow\) when only set of spectral lines can be observed redshifting/blueshifting
\item this is due to Doppler shifting when one of the binaries is relativistically coming towards us and the other away
\item Doppler shift (\(\Delta\lambda\)) can be related to the radial velocity (the component of the velocity on our line of sight)
\item \[\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v_{rad}}{c}\]
\end{list}
\subsection{Eclipsing Binaries}
Binaries where one star passes in front of the other at some point during its period
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item A partial eclipse will happen if  
\item \[\sin(\phi) < \sin(\phi_0) = \frac{R_1+R_2}{a}\]
\item where inclination \(i\) is defined as the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky \(\rightarrow\) \(\phi = 90 \degree - i\) and \(a\) is the orbital radius  
\item and a total eclipse will occur if 
\item \[\sin(\phi) < \sin(\phi_1) = \frac{R_1-R_2}{a}\]
\item We assume that the angles between line of sight and orbital planes are random, the probability of having an angle between 0 and \(\phi_0\) is the fraction of the surface area of the half sphere between the pole and the circle at an angle \(\phi_0\) from the pole, which is equal to \(2\pi(1-\cos(\phi_0))\). While the area of the half sphere is \(2\pi\)\footnote{Try this myself and verify that this makes sense}. Thus, the probability of having an eclipse is 
\item \[\mathcal{F}_{eclipse} = (1-\cos\phi_0)\]
\item Assuming \(\phi_0\) small
\item \[\sin\phi \simeq \phi_0 \simeq \frac{(R_1 +R)_2}{a}\]
\item due to series expansion\footnote{for sure do this at some point}
\item \[\cos\phi_0 \simeq 1 - \frac{(R_1 + R_2)^2}{2a^2}\]
\item Thus
\item \[\mathcal{F}_{eclipse} =\frac{(R_1 + R_2)^2}{2a^2} \]
\item Because \(R_1 +R_2 < a\), eclipses are most likely for either dwarf stars with a  very close orbital radius, or wide binaries where at least one star is a giant 
\end{list}

\subsection{}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item It is possible for a spinning WDs to show variation (but not pulses) in star brightness
\item This is because of the magnetic fields on WDs causing bright spots
\item Pulsation can be determined by the density 
\end{list}
\noindent \textbf{\large Novae/CVs}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Caused my mass transfer onto a WD
\item WD shell goes SN, causing Novae
\item Standard candle
\item Has a variation called dwarf Novae 
\item caused by instability in the accretion disk
\item much weaker
\end{list}

\subsection{}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Brightest sources of x-rays were found to be CV accreting systems
\end{list}

\subsection{}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item The first NS star XrB
\item Regular periodicity of with increase of x-ray emission
\item Caused by the NS being obscured by the larger star
\end{list}

\subsection{First BH XrB}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Discovered x-ray source with nearby supergiant
\item Falls into two classes
\item HMXBs and LMXBs
\item determined by the mass of the acceptor with respect to the donor
\item x-ray emission called by infilling matter
\item \(\frac{GMm}{R} = .01mc^2\)\footnote{Shockingly simple eq}
\item much much much more efficient than any fusion reactor on earth
\item values as high as \(.42mc^2\)
\item Common in Globular clusters
\end{list}

\subsection{Double NSs \& BHs}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Proved by GW detection
\item Detections are dominated by DBHs 
\item DNSs formed through lower mass binaries
\end{list}

\subsection{MSPs}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Generally remnants of LMXBs
\item Systems with \gls{MSP}s generally have WD partners
\item Mass-transfer through evolution, or through orbital momentum loss through or GWR
\item The NS is greatly accelerated through accretion
\item Old NSs which evolved through this process are called \textit{\gls{Recylced-Pulsar}s}
\end{list}

\subsection{Results of evolution in binaries}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item SNe caused by the death of stars more massive than \(\sim8M_\odot\)
\item SNe types
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item \gls{TI-SNe}
\item \gls{TIb-SNe}
\item \gls{TIc-SNe}
\item \gls{TII-SNe} 
\end{list}
\item due to the fact that \gls{TIb-SNe} and \gls{TIc-SNe} are stripped cores, it is incredibly likely that they result from binary systems
\item We may also observe both \gls{TIb-SNe} and \gls{TIc-SNe} in \gls{WR}, however, we have \textbf{not} yet
\item WD SNe (section \ref{WD-SNe}) \textit{require} some sort of mass transfer process
\item The companion donor can be either a standard star (\gls{SD}), or another WD (\gls{DD})
\end{list}

\subsection{Weird stars}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Blue stragglers
\item Barium 
\end{list}


\section{Orbits and masses of spectroscopic binaries}
\setcounter{subsection}{3}
\subsection{}
This is generally all math that I either know from astro classes, or is so specific id need to revisit it to use anyway\\

\[\frac{L}{L_\odot} = \frac{M}{M_\odot}^{3.5}, M > 1.3M_\odot\]

\subsection{Very massive stars}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Most massive has \(L \sim 10^ L_\odot\)
\item Because of the high (\(\sim50000k\)) temps, they have strong stellar wind, and thus very similar spectra to \gls{WR}, which they are distinguished from by the presence of hydrogen 
\item Denoted as \gls{WNh}
\end{list}

\subsection{Stuff that screws up rad vel curves}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Rad Vel curve must be off due to a difference in eccentricity values derived from the rad curve and the light curve
\item Rotation effect
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item when the stars are eclipsing the rotational Doppler shift can be added (if the half spinning away from us is obscured) or subtracted to the shift, leading to different rad velocity measurements. This is called the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. \footnote{This is actually a super neat and intuitive process which i feel like the book just sorta skips and doesnt explain, maybe wanna write out/make some graphics bout this sometime}
\end{list}
\item presence of gas streams
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item wow they could have said literally anything about what a gas stream is in this case
\item im guessing it means some sort of flow of mass coming off of the binaries, maybe in accretion, maybe in jets???
\end{list}
\item reflection effect
\item heating effect
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item Both the reflection and heating effect are caused by that the stars will cast light on each other, both heating and causing reflection
\end{list}
\item deformation effect
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item the above effects cause the curve to be shifted from the c.m., leading to wonky radial vel curves
\end{list}
\item  this is actually pretty important when it comes to HMXBs and properly measuring NS and BH masses
\end{list}


\subsection{Interacting binaries}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item \(> 70\%\) of massive o-type stars are members of binaries so close that they'll exchange mass or merge before either star explode as a SN

\end{list}
the rest of this section follows the ``way too niche of math to write down'' thing

\section{Roche equipotential}\footnote{I have a ridiculous amount of notes and a whole essay written about this, so notes here Wil be pretty light}

\begin{list}{-}{}
\item This is some black magic mathmathmatic reasoning 
\item Co-rotating binaries with have a tidal bulge that can be `easily' calculated
\item also love the seemingly kinda personal rant about how the RL diagram is actually wrong, then provides a diagram which is way less intuitive  
\item 
\end{list}
\setcounter{section}{-1}
\section{Misc}
\subsection{WD SNe}\label{WD-SNe}
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item This, simply-ish put, is caused by because a WD cannot reach hydrostatic equilibrium. A pressure increase does \textbf{not} lead to increase and radius, and thus cooling, instead, it just increases heat, and thus fusion, quickly getting out of hand. Can b trigged if the \gls{Chandrasekhar-limit} is crossed, as well as if a layer of H/He on top entities, called a \gls{edge-limit-detonation} or ``sub-Chandrasekhar'' explosions.
\item In \gls{DD} systems the WDs must have a small separation, causing \gls{GWR} to shrink the separation until merger \(\rightarrow\) SNe
\end{list}
