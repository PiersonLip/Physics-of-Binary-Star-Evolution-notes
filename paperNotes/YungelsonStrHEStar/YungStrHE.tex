\subsection{Stripped Helium Star Properties}

\begin{list}{-}{}
\item non\gls{Degenerate-matter} He-cores of which retained a \(\lesssim 1 M_\odot\) hydrogen-helium envelope.  This chemical abundance is formed by numerous aspects
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item the retreat of an H-burning convective core in MS 
\item Mixing! 
\item Mass loss during RLOF 
\item Stellar wind from a post RLOF remnant
\end{list}
\item Masses of \((1-7)M_\odot\)
\item None have been identified 
\item Most are lower mass \((\gtrsim 2M_\odot)\)
\item Their formation is heavily constrained by \gls{runaway-RLOF} 
\item Likely progenitors of both hydrogen-poor and hydrogen-rich core-collapse SNe, occurring when their CO core exceeds \(\approx 1.4 M_\odot\)
\item stars with mass \(\lesssim 2M_\odot\) with hydrogen-depleted envelopes are sdO/B-type subdwarf and stripped stars with mass \(\gtrsim 7M_\odot\) are Wolf-Rayet stars. This gap is believed to be filled with HeS stars 
\item 
\end{list}

\subsection{Case B RLO}\label{Yungelson-case-b-rlo}
``At solar metallicity \(Z = Z_\odot\) this results in the formation of a system with a He white dwarf component, if the \gls{ZAMS} donor mass is \(\lesssim 2.5 M_\odot\) or a hot \((\log(T_{eff} \lesssim 4.4))\) stripped helium star (HeS) component, if the donors ZAMS mass is higher and the mass-loss by its stellar wind does not prevent RLOF''
