\subsection{`Elusive hot stripped helium stars in the {Galaxy}' \cite{yungelson_elusive_2024}}
\subsubsection{Stripped Helium Star Properties}

\begin{list}{-}{}
\item non\gls{Degenerate-matter} He-cores of 
\item Masses of \((1-7)M_\odot\)
\item None have been identified 
\item Most are lower mass \((\gtrsim 2M_\odot)\)
\item Their formation is heavily constrained by \gls{runaway-RLOF} 
\item 
\end{list}

\subsubsection{Case B RLO}\label{Yungelson-case-b-rlo}
``At solar metallicity \(Z = Z_\odot\) this results in the formation of a system with a He white dwarf component, if the \gls{ZAMS} donor mass is \(\lesssim 2.5 M_\odot\) or a hot \((\log(T_{eff} \lesssim 4.4))\) stripped helium star (HeS) component, if the donors ZAMS mass is higher and the mass-loss by its stellar wind does not prevent RLOF''
